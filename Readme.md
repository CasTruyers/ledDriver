### DESCRIPTION

The emergence of indoor vertical agriculture with LEDs is stimulating new technological developments to operate the LEDs efficiently. The LED controller discussed in this application note is used in vertical farming for controlling and automating the LED infrastructure. The schematic used for the LED controller, is found in the Elektor magazine. This LED driver can control up to 4 different LED strips individually. Why would you want to control 4 different LED strips individually? Well, each plant type and its growing stage prefer a specific light spectrum. So, if we give each LED strip a specific light spectrum we can then, by adjusting the intensity of each strip individually, control the total light spectrum for a specific plant type and its growing stage.

### FEATURES

* PWM dimming.
* Day/night cycles.
* Convenient WEB interface for controlling the LEDs.
* Constant current.
* up to 450mA per LED strip.
* reduced noise to LEDs
* reduced pollution to grid.
